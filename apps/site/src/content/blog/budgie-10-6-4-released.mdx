[Budgie 10.6.4](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6.4?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org) is the fourth minor release in the 10.6 series of our Budgie Desktop environment. This release contains bug fixes and build system improvements.

These changes are backported from our in-progress 10.7 series, which will feature major upgrades to Budgie Menu, our internal theming, and more. This development process allows us to focus longer-term on features and larger overhauls while still being able to address issues [raised on our issue tracker](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org) in a timely manner.
