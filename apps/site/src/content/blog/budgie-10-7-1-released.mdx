[Budgie 10.7.1](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.7.1?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org) is the first minor release in the 10.7 series of our Budgie Desktop environment, introducing some improvements, bug fixes, and updated translations.

## Improvements

![](/images/blog/2023/02/BudgieDesktopSettings_EnableUndirection.jpg)

- Our settings / functionality for toggling unredirection has been improved. Unredirection allows frames to bypass the compositor for fullscreen applications, reducing overhead and improving performance in scenarios such as gaming. In previous releases, the option would be for _disabling_ unredirection with the setting being _off_ by default, meaning unredirection was enabled. This was confusing for both end users as well as in the implementation of the functionality. This setting has now been updated to be `Enable unredirection`, with the option _enabled_ by default, with clearer explanation for the end user.

- Initial Mutter 12 ABI support has been added in preparation for the upcoming GNOME 44 release. [#305](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/305?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org)
- Margins have been refined in the Budgie Desktop Settings panel settings layout to be aligned with that of the settings layout for Raven settings. [#295](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/295?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org)
