Budgie 10.8.2 is the second minor release in the 10.8 series of our Budgie Desktop environment. This release features some bug fixes around the system tray, notifications, and a small improvement to Budgie Screenshot.

## Bug Fixes

- System Tray icon scaling will now be correctly applied on initial launch, fixing a bug where you needed to toggle the scaling on and off again for it to re-apply in the "off" position. [#467](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/467)
- Fix custom icon path reading in System Tray, resulting in an unresponsive panel over time for some users. [#456](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/456)
- Added fallback logic to our AppInfo fetching for Notifications. Some applications (such as nemo and streamlink-twitch-gui) have a mismatch between the `desktop-entry` they provide and their desktop file. In cases where the hint fails, we will now try to guess the ID using the application's name given to us from DBus. [#477](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/477)

## Improvements

- Budgie Screenshot will now use a more limited scoped directory for the temporary image it generates. This temporary image will attempt to store itself as `.budgiescreenshot_tempfile` in the user's `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, falling back to the user's `HOME` directory if that runtime directory does not exist. This is more aligned with the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), which specifies that user-specific runtime and other file objects should be placed in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.
