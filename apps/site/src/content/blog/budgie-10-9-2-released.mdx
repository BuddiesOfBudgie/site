Budgie 10.9.2 is the second minor release of Budgie 10.9 series of our Budgie Desktop environment. This release fixes some bugs related to notifications, workspace applet, TabSwitcher and more.

While we have been hard at work on our Wayland porting efforts for our upcoming 10.10 release, we felt it important to provide a small release to address some of the issues that have been reported by our users, as well as to make it easier for packagers of Budgie to get the most relevant fixes to users without introducing any of the larger Wayland-related changes that have either already landed in our main development branch or will be over the course of 10.10's development.

## Bug Fixes

- Budgie Menu: We will now show applications which report as being Terminal-based (e.g. `Terminal=true` in their desktop file). Users of applications like Neovim rejoice!
- Budgie Run Dialog: Fixed a regression where our setting of skip pager and taskbar was not being called during construction, which resulted in it showing up in our task switchers (IconTasklist and Task List).
- Dialogs: Fixed end session dialogs blocking authentication dialogs.
- Notifications: Fixed an issue where a notification's default action would be performed when the close button was clicked.
- Specification Compliance: Fixed an issue where we referred to the restart / reboot icon as "system-restart-symbolic" instead of "system-reboot-symbolic". This should improve compatibility with icon themes while retaining our own icon as a fallback in the event the icon theme does not provide it.
- System Tray: Fixed an issue whereby some applications would not show with their intended icon. This is the result of such applications (e.g. Cinny and Tauon) being non-compliant with the [StatusNotifierItem specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/StatusNotifierItem/) by providing absolute paths to icons instead of either an icon name or icon data.
- TabSwitcher: We will no longer show an empty switcher when there are no windows to actually switch between.
- Workspace Applet
  - Fixed an issue where clicking a window icon would not perform an intended workspace switch.
  - Fixed left scroll direction. In libxfce4windowing, _our_ concept of "left" maps to their "down", but "right" is still "right".
- build: Re-hide warnings that were previously hidden in Meson < 1.4.0. In 1.4.0, it began to show warnings that are largely the result of bad C codegen in the Vala compiler, resulting in unreadable log spam and making it substantially more difficult to see actual warnings that need to be addressed.
- vapi: update to support libxfce4windowing 4.19.3
