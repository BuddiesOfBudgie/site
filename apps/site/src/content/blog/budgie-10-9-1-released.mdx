Budgie 10.9.1 is the first minor release of Budgie 10.9 series of our Budgie Desktop environment. This release squashes some bugs in the TabSwitcher and Workspace applet.

## Bug Fixes

- TabSwitcher
  - Fixed inconsistent window focusing.
  - Fixed windows from other workspaces showing up when the user has not enabled the "Show all windows" option.
  - Added dynamic max column setting on our switcher's FlowBox, so it will no longer take up more room than necessary.
- Workspace applet
  - Fixed icon scaling when using scaling that is greater than 100%.
- Added missing manpage for org.buddiesofbudgie.sendto.
- Updated default vendor wallpaper.
