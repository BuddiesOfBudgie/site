Buddies of Budgie was founded to provide a home for the Budgie Desktop, an open source modern desktop environment built to provide you immediate access to the things you need, and keep out of the way when you need it to most.

Budgie Desktop provides a multitude of features that helps to accomplish this, such as:

Budgie Menu: Budgie Menu shows you all your installed applications, neatly organized into categories to improve discoverability, and with lightning fast application searching! No more diving into sub-menus to find the app you need.

Raven: Raven is an all-in-one center for accessing your calendar, controlling sound output and input (including per-app volume control), media playback and more. Raven also enables you to access missed notifications, with the ability to clear away individual notifications, grouped notifications, and all notifications.

Run Dialog: Quickly launch apps without lifting a finger!

Budgie is an extensible and personalizable desktop. With a rich ecosystem of extensions developed the community and a ton of customization options from supported themes, panel configuration, and more -- you can make Budgie feel like home.

Budgie Desktop is currently built on top of libraries and software developed by the GNOME Foundation, a "homegrown" environment (as opposed to a fork of an existing desktop) using the GTK3 toolkit and leverages Mutter for the basis of its window manager.

The original focal point of Budgie was the operating system evolveOS (nowadays called Solus). As the project evolved, other operating systems introduced support for our environment, and some even were created out of a desire to marry our desktop environment with the user's preferred choice of operating system (like Ubuntu Budgie).

Buddies of Budgie is the result of years of engagement with this global community of contributors and consumers. Our "North Star" is transforming historically "downstream" consumers of Budgie into partners, involved directly in Budgie's evolution and development. Some of our other pillars are:
- Being open-minded to new ideas that can help positively shape a Linux user's experience, new and existing alike, while not compromising on the vision for Budgie.
- Focusing on being a platform rather than a product. Distributors of Budgie Desktop and users should not feel like their choice of theming, applications, or default styles should be at odds with the goals of the project. More focus should be put into enabling these "consumers", with a sane set of customization capabilities and APIs that facilitate extensibility.
- Interoperability with various standards (such as those from FreeDesktop), whether that is in the context of "current" Budgie (10 series) or future releases.
